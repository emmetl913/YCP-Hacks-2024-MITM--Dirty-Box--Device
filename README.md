# Overview
This project was created by Caleb Jones, Brandon Woodward, Zachary Cox, and Emmet Larson as a submission for the 2024 York College of Pennsylvania Hackathon. The theme of the event was 'Matrix' and our team decided we wanted to create a USB device that can scrape files off a computer and remotely upload them to a web server which we hosted on a local network. The contents of the project were demonstrated in a controlled environment with consent of those whose computers we used the device on. That being said, we do not endorse the use of this software/hardware for illegal activities, nor are we responsible for individuals who do as such. This document will server as an overview of what our project is and how we implemented the above features.
